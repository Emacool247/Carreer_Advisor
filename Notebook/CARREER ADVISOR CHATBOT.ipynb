    "# Career Path Advisor Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìå Project Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build an **advisor chatbot** that helps individuals make informed career decisions. The chatbot will recommend possible **career paths** based on the skills a person currently possesses and also suggest **additional skills** they can learn to expand their opportunities and transition into different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Problem Statement\n",
    "Many people have valuable skills but struggle to identify:\n",
    "- The types of jobs or roles they are best suited for.\n",
    "- What complementary skills they need to acquire in order to pivot into new industries or advance in their careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lack of clarity often leads to underemployment or missed opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Solution\n",
    "The Career Path Advisor Chatbot will:\n",
    "1. Accept a list of **current skills** from a user.\n",
    "2. Map these skills to **job descriptions** in a dataset of careers.\n",
    "3. Recommend relevant **job titles and career paths** that align with the user‚Äôs existing skill set.\n",
    "4. Suggest **new skills to learn** that complement the current ones and enable the user to transition into other fields or improve employability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìä Dataset\n",
    "The project uses a dataset of **job descriptions**, including:\n",
    "- **Job Titles**\n",
    "- **Required Skills**\n",
    "- **Job Descriptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset provides the foundation for matching user skills to career opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Methodology\n",
    "- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and structure job descriptions and skill requirements.\n",
    "- **Skill Extraction & Matching**: Use NLP techniques to extract skills from text and match them to user input.\n",
    "- **Recommendation System**: Suggest suitable jobs and additional skills for career advancement.\n",
    "- **Chatbot Interface**: Deploy the solution as an interactive chatbot that users can engage with naturally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Expected Outcome\n",
    "By the end of this project, users will have a **personalized career advisor chatbot** that:\n",
    "- Guides them toward roles that match their current skills.\n",
    "- Provides clear advice on **what to learn next** to remain competitive and versatile in the job market.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool can empower individuals to take control of their career growth and explore opportunities they may not have considered otherwise.\n"
